# Music Genre Detection and Recommendation.

## About the Project:
Music is an essential unwinding for most of us. With new songs added to music streaming platforms like Spotify, Amazon Prime Music, JioSaavn every week, music listeners want to keep their playlist updated.

The aim of this project is to classify the genre of songs, mainly into: Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Reggae, Country, Disco, Classical, Jazz with the help of an application built on Flask. Along with the genre, users of the application get recommended with upto three songs similar to the one searched for.
Key features:
